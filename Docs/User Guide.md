Once the module has been added, configurations for all board **Bank** and **Line** parameters are available. These properties are applied on deployment of the system definition.

Each **Bank** and **Line** also has channels added to the system definition so board configuration can be changed while the system is deployed. The settings for these channels are only updated in the deployed system when a **Command** is sent. They are not updated when the channel value changes.

**Command** apply a specific command each time the channel value is changed from **0** to **1**. In order to change a channel configuration, use the **Update Channel Configuration** channel. For example, to enable _Line 0_ on _Port 0_, set the _Line 0_ **Enable** channel to **1** and then set the **Update Channel Configuration** channel to **1**. This will send a property change to the SLSC-12201 card and command to apply those changes.

**Diagnostic** channels are also provided to show the state of various parts of the board. **SLSC Mod Update Rate** and **SLSC Mod Loop Rate** provide information about the loop rate of the asynchronous loop in the custom device. The various **Power Fail** channels will remain set until the **Acknowledge Vsup Fail** command channel has been set.
